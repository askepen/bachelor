# GSM Compression
From [Fgee et. al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/808013?casa_token=mrPhjghaRO0AAAAA:7SRrQqvORoh1NSnkpgGpRF_0-ZyaZjQ9idWeZ8lOJ63R1MD39SHVjdZ0HnNYi4kSftJ2wQKZTgdzXA):

> GSM Compression uses the algorithm GSM (Global System Mobile) which reduces the data rate by a factor of almost five with little degradation of voice-grade audio. This algorithm is based on a Regular Pulse Excited-Linear Predictive Coder (RPELPC) which compresses speech with two filters and an initial excitation
